    <h1>Timetagg Promotional Page</h1>
    <p>
    Timetagg is a small North Vancouver based startup which is currently building a web application for managing time. As lead designer on the project I was tasked with building a promotional website for the platform which outlined many of Timetaggâ€™s key features. The website features a brief description of the platform and team behind the project as well as a section for users to sign up for the upcoming beta. The website is responsive and easily viewed at any screen size.
