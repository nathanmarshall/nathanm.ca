    <h1>LDRLY</h1>
    <p>
    LDRLY is Vancouver based startup which builds a gamer intelligence platform for social and mobile games. Over the past few months I have worked alongside a small group of designers and developers helping conceptualize and build the platforms interactive experience. The LDRLY platform is easily integrated into an existing game and provides players with the ability to track game statistics, view leaderboards as well as compete and interact with other players. LDRLY can currently be seen integrated into East Side Game's Pot Farm with more games coming soon.
