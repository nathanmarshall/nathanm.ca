    <h1>A Space Odyssey</h1>
    <p>
    A parallax scrolling website that takes you on a journey across our solar system. It was an exciting opportunity to explore the use of javascript and parallax to create an interactive E-learning experience. Your venture will begin at the Sun, taking you across the vast traverse of our galactic neighbourhood. Along the way you will learn some of the key concepts about the planets and objects that inhabit our solar system. When you have reached the end of your journey, you will have the option to test your knowledge with a short quiz. This website uses parallax and is therefore best viewed in a desktop browser.
