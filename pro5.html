    <h1>Personal Branding</h1>
    <p>
    A personal branding project in which I created a logo as well as an accompanying style guide outlining the use of brand assets. The logo combines the the initials of my first and last name into a single illustrative entity. It features a custom typeface which characterizes a clean and minimal approach to design.
